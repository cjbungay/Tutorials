[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Install and set up abapGit)]

  As next you need to install `abapGit` on our `on-premise` system.

> **Important!** Arrange with your system administrator before you install `zabapgit`.

  1. Copy the content of the latest build from the program `zabapgit`, that you will find in the `abapGit` repository `https://github.com/larshp/abapGit`.

  2. Open your `on-premise` system of your choice and create a new program and paste the content from step 1 into it.

  3. Activate and execute the program.

  4. If you have installed `abapGit` before, you need to go to SE38, search for **ZABAPGIT** program and press **Execute**.
